1. Define Property Class 
    properties: 
      (name, type, colour, price, rent) 
    methods: 
      duplicateRent()

2. Define Player Class 
    properties: 
      (name: "", wallet: 16, location: 0, properties: []) 
    methods: 
      addToWallet(num) 
      substractFromWallet(num) 
      changeLocation(num)
      addproperty(property)

3. Create the Board
    List of Properties

4. Create the players List

5. Create the two rolls Lists: 
    game1 / game2.

// START

6. Ask the user to choose game1 or game2
7. Divide the chosen game list into a list of rounds:
     len(round) = len(players)
8. Recursive function that keeps going until the game list is empty. 
     rounds = createRoundList(roll)
      // Can use s loop: While i<4 const turn_array = [] 
      // const dice = roll.shift()

9. Start the round
    Loop through the round list while all players still have money:
     While i<turns.length and all player.wallets > 0
      Get the first turn = turns[i]

7.  Loop to Play the round --- Call this recursively until either the wallet is 0 or round is empty
      Play the first round for j=0 while j<turn.length
      Get the first player player = players[j]
      Get the dice roll value dice = turn[j]

8.    function to get the correct location:
        const newLocation = dice + player.location
        Set the new location: 
          newLoc < 9 ? player.Loc = newLoc : player.Loc = newLoc % 9 && player.wallet += 1
          // That last bit is because we need to add the 1 dolar to the wallet if newLoc is bigger
     *** Added this as a method to the player class ***

9.    function to buy or pay rent
        if I own it:
          Go to the next player j++ -- call play()
        elif it doesn't have an owner:
          if enough money:
            buy it (call wallet.substract method + addProperty).
            check if player has got 2 properties of the same colour:
             yes: duplicate both properties rent.
             no: move to next player
          else: GAME OVER
        else: 
          payRent():
             if no money: 
              GAME OVER
             else:
              call wallet.subtract() for the player and wallet.add() for the landlord


10. Function to declare who is the winner
      findWinner(players) 
      discard the looser :( filter the array
      loop through the array comparing and return the one with the most $$
      print("And the winner is!")
// STOP
